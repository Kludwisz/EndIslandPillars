# EndIslandPillars
This repository contains the source code I used to find the tallest possible pillars<br>
made out of small end islands for version 1.16.1. The final results of the project are listed below.<br>
You can find more similar seeds, as well as some intermediate seeds in the .txt files<br>
in src/main/cuda/endislands and src/main/java/endislands.

# Credits
I'd like to thank the following seedfinding community members, without whom the project<br>
wouldn't have been possible:<br><br>
- Neil, KaptainWutax and mjtb49 for their seedfinding libraries,
- Colin for his research into small end island generation
- Cubitect for the C Java Random implementation in the Cubiomes library
